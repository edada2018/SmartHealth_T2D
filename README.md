# Smart Health: Summer Research in Diabetes Prediction Using ML

## Duration
**Summer 2025 (1 Month)**

## Project Objective
This project demonstrates how supervised machine learning algorithms can be applied to detect early-stage **Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)** using the **UCI diabetes dataset**. It is part of a summer research initiative focused on the intersection of healthcare and AI.

## Dataset

- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Name:** [Early-stage diabetes risk prediction dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset)

---

## ML Algorithms Used

The following supervised learning models will be implemented and evaluated:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree (DT)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## Evaluation Metrics

We will evaluate models based on:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC
- Confusion Matrix

---

## Key Tasks

1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection & Normalization  
4. Model Training & Evaluation  
5. Result Comparison & Conclusion
